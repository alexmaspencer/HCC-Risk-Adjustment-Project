# HCC-Risk-Adjustment-Project
SquareML Internship Project
This project was done during an internship at Square ML. The aim of this project was to create an automated version of HCC Risk Adjustment. Developing a Python-based Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) risk adjustment model has been a pivotal project in my journey to enhance healthcare analytics. By implementing the HCC algorithm, I analyzed patient data to predict healthcare costs and outcomes, a crucial task for organizations aiming to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.
